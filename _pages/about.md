Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [NECPHY-LAB](http://necphy-lab.com/), Institut National de la Recherque Scientifique ([INRS](http://www.inrs.ca/english/homepage)), [University du Qu√©bec](http://www.uquebec.ca/reseau/fr), supervised by Prof. [Long Le](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=-STl68rkz_kC&hl=en&oi=ao). My current research interests include mobile edge computing, radio resource management, 5G new radio, and AI for wireless communications.
